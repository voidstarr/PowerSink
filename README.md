# PowerSink
Sponge API 7.3.x Plugin that allows players to pay for energy, or earn money selling energy.

This plugin is in a rough proof of concept state.

Currently supported energy backends:
  * Forge
  * Mekanism
  
Current implementation borrows from [PowerMoney](https://github.com/AuraDevelopmentTeam/PowerMoney)'s MoneyCalculator.
